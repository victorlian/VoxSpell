vlia679

To run, simply double click on the SpellingAid.jar file.

Please make sure the following things are in the same directory as the jar file.
(don't move, rename or delete these files!)
- NZCER-spelling-lists.txt
- big_buck_bunny_1_minute.avi
- reversed.avi
- image (folder)

Features to be implemented:
1. Sound rewards. (festival will only say correct at the moment)
2. Clearing stats/storing stats files.
3. Settings panel will receive some UI updates on fonts/layout
4. Some new line charcters may have been printed incorrectly or missing.

Warnings:
1. The program does allow you to change a wordlist, but the wordlist MUST: 
	- have the same format as NZCER
	- have 11 levels, namely 1-11
	- have at least 10 words for each level.
   Otherwise, might result in unexpected behaviour/exceptions being thrown.
2. The debug panel is included for developers only. It will be removed once 
   deployed. (The cheat button may be helpful when doing a new quiz, it tells
   you the current word being spelt)
